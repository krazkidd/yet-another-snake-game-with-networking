Players connect to a central lobby server which maintains an authoritative game state (i.e. the game is not P2P). Multiple game modes will be supported, not just classic Snake.

The current development branch is 'branches/authoritative server'. 'trunk' is a working single-player game that just passes nonsense over the network to a server.
